# Exercises

# 1.
# Vectorised has two meanings. First, it means (broadly) that a function inputs a vector or vectors 
# and does something to each element. Secondly, it usually implies that these operations are implemented in a compiled language such as C or Fortran, so that the implementation is very fast.

# 2.
#  possibly() modifies functions to return a specified default value (otherwise) in case of an error and to suppress any error messages (quiet = TRUE).

# 3.
# safely() modifies functions to return a list, containing the elements result and error.
# safely() also provides the otherwise and quiet arguments. 

# 4.
# Both commands will print a dot every 10 downloads and will take the same amount of time to run, so the differences may seem quite subtle.

# 5.
# Memoising file.download() will only work if the files are immutable, i.e. if the file at a given URL is always the same.
